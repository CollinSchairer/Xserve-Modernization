Making Apple's beautiful but whacky servers of old useable in 2023.

This project aims to adapt modern ATX computer hardware into the 1U Xserve chassis while maintaining as much of the original design and hardware as possible.
As I work through this project, less and less of this original hardware seems to be useable, but I'm trying my best.

The main components of this modification are a revised front panel I/O and indication board, hard drive caddy modifications, a revised and modernized 
SATA (Maybe SAS?) backplane, and a revised back panel to fit an ATX motherboard I/O cutout and Flex ATX power supply.
